# [₹Query](https://razorpay.com/rquery) — Nationalised, Localised JavaScript for India

A revolutionary web framework designed for truly nationalistic web apps. Since demonetisation and US presidential elections, we knew that ₹ is the future and we can't rely on $ anymore. ₹Query is a drop in replacement for jQuery that allows you to ditch the $ and move to ₹ instantly!

# Usage

## Including rQuery

To include rQuery, you need to add this line in the head of your HTML:

```
<script src="//cdn.razorpay.com/rquery.js"></script>
```

And that's it! You are now all equipped to launch the next bestselling, GMV bragging, nationalistic app!

## Writing ₹Query

To start writing in ₹Query, you need a code block like this:

```
<script type="rupeescript"></script>
```

Now go ahead and write your heart out:

```
<script type="rupeescript">
  ₹('.element').onClick(function(){
    console.log('Mujhko bhi to lift karade');
  });
</script>
```

## Special Methods

While all methods of jQuery are available in ₹Query too, we are proud to announce some of the most powerful JavaScript methods to be part of any framework.

### `demonetize`

Have you ever wanted to remove an element from all your customers devices, no matter how many have it? `demonetize` method enables this:

```
/**
 * To demonetize an element
 */
₹('.element-selector').demonetize();

/**
 * To demonetize an element on a particular date
 */
₹('.element-selector').demonetize(1478629800); // 9th November 2016, 00:00:00
```

### Animation

India is land of vibrant culture. Our art forms are varied and finally here's a framework that does justice to it. Introducing Indian animations:

```
₹('.element-selector').bhangra();
₹('.element-selector').bharatnatyam();
```

We are hard at work to introduce more such methods. Keep watching this space for more!

# Credit
While we lament the poor choice of jQuery team in selecting $, we would still like to thank them for all the great work they have done over the years and urge them to move to ₹Query. But seriously, thanks for making web awesome!
